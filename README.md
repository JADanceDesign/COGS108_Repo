# Hi, welcome to my channel. Don't forget to drop a comment down below and like this video if you want to see more content. For today's video we will talk about the immoral practices of large corporations in the face of climate change and the inevitable destruction of land and resources that their greed will unleash upon every atom of this planet! And don't let them fool you, more than 70% of all pollution and warming can be traced to large business so never let them trick you into placing the blame on the one individual with a straw while the plastic companies recieve no blame or attention?!?!?! Also look at my cat princess isn't she cute <3
